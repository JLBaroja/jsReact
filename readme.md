This package explores using Javascript (JS) in R to create interactive app. 

The basic framework is set and I am expanding on examples (located in the 'inst' folder. Source the R files to run the examples). Collaboration is welcomed! 

## For friends

- This package aims at experienced users in R. 

- This is a package that helps you transit from R to Javascript (for interactive visualisation). Ideally, you would use this package for 3-4 weeks, then you become skillful enough to not use this package.

- I argue **a little of JS (and a lot of copy-and-paste) goes a long way**. In fact, I can be more specific, you can build a lot knowing only three functions from each JS library. I used one JS library (p5.js) for the following app, guess how many functions from that library I have used? and how many lines of JS I have written?

Answers: 9 functions (where 8 of them are: mouseReleased, mouseIsPressed, keyIsPressed, setup, createCanvas, draw, fill, rect) and in total of 82 lines of JS. (sidenote: 100 lines are about how far I would go (as a R user) to create apps like this.)

- Just as one needs to know C++ to utilise package like Rcpp to improve performance, it's nice to learn some JS to leverage existing JS libraries for data visualisation.

- We have enough tools really, we need more design.
